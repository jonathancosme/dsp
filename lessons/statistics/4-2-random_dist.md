[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

yes the numbers are uniform. 
You can't see it in the Pmf historygram because the Pmf is normalized (so it looks like a blank graph). 
If you plotted the raw random numbers, you would see a uniform distribution. 
It's clear on the CDF, plot since you essentially have a line with a slope of 1, meaning that the probability remains constant.
